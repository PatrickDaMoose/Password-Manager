Hello!

This is a Password Manager made following Udemy's 100 Days of Code, Python Bootcamp.

I utilized TKinter to build the UI and built two functions to handle generating random passwords and saving those passwords to a file.

When hitting the "add" button, a new file will be generated in the programs directory called "data.txt" with the information provided in the program.

The only thing I've found to break the program is to not include the logo.png.

Thanks for checking this out.
